## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **`--auto-bypass` — a fully unattended `/crg-farm` run through commit and an opened draft PR.**
  A separate, standalone flag from `--auto` (never implied by it, never inferred from prior
  approvals): it auto-passes every gate up through `GATE-DIFF` (commit) and a HARD-promoted
  `GATE-ESCALATE` on regression — which climbs to the next, strictly higher tier, **never a retry
  of the tier that just failed**. Every tier gets exactly one shot, always; a `haiku` start can
  still climb through two regressions (to `sonnet`, then `opus`) before running out of ladder.
  Truncates ranked candidates to the top 5 (§Ranking) and runs their TRIAGE→FIX→PR pipelines
  concurrently, capped at 5 in-flight. `GATE-SUBMIT` is never bypassed by any flag — every PR this
  opens **stops at draft**; flipping one to ready-for-review stays a deliberate, separate human
  action. A regression that's still unclean once `maxTier` itself has regressed drops that
  candidate from PR-prep and marks it `handed-to-human` in the run's closing report instead of
  committing an unclean diff. Every gate decision it auto-passes is logged `bypass:true` (never
  `auto:true`), keeping the audit trail able to distinguish a human "yes" from `--auto`'s
  soft-gate defaults from a fully unattended bypass. See `skills/crg-farm/methodology.md`
  §Auto-bypass mode.
- **`workflows/crg-debug.farm-bypass.js` — the harness-held option for `--auto-bypass`.** A new
  deterministic Workflow, installed by the existing `crg-deterministic` enabler, that owns RECON
  (dedup + rank + the top-5 cap), TRIAGE, FIX/escalation, and PR-prep in real JS instead of prompt
  compliance — the top-5 cap, the 5-way concurrency cap, and the one-shot-per-tier escalation rule
  are all enforced in code (a strictly-climbing tier function that cannot return the tier it was
  just called with), not trusted to a model self-policing them across up to 5 parallel repos.
  Composes the existing `crg-debug.js` Workflow unmodified via the `workflow()` nesting primitive
  for both TRIAGE and FIX passes, so the underlying detect/fix engine is identical between prose
  and harness auto-bypass. `/crg-farm --auto-bypass` prefers it automatically once installed;
  `--prose` forces the prompt-driven path (needed for a scoped `/xplore` sweep, which a Workflow
  agent can't run). See `skills/crg-farm/methodology.md` §Auto-bypass mode → "Prose vs. harness".

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **`/crg-farm` RECON ranks fresh candidates by impact × review-likelihood.** Previously GATE-RECON
  showed an unordered dump of fresh candidates, which stopped being triageable once a themed or
  wildcard search returned 20+ results. RECON now pulls two signals per distinct repo —
  `stargazerCount` (blast-radius proxy) and the last 5 merged-PR timestamps (review-cadence proxy:
  tight spacing means active review, a stale gap since the last merge demotes a repo even if its
  historical cadence looked fast) — and combines them with an impact read of the issue body itself
  (data-loss/security/safety-relevant bugs outrank functional breakage, which outranks cosmetic
  ones). Candidates sort impact-first, review-likelihood as tiebreaker/demotion, with the signals
  recorded on each `candidate` farm-DB row (`rankSignals`). Because a ranked list commonly exceeds
  the 4-option cap on a gate, `select-subset` at `GATE-RECON` is now a two-step pick: the ranked
  list posted as plain text, then a compact cut-point follow-up (Top-5/Top-10/Top-N/Custom). See
  `skills/crg-farm/methodology.md` §Ranking.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- **`/crg-farm` no longer defaults RECON to the current-directory repo.** The skill's `repoRoot`
  resolution silently fell back to `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, so an unscoped invocation would
  farm bugs in whatever repo happened to be the working directory instead of sourcing candidates
  from GitHub. RECON now resolves a mode from `direction`: **scoped** (a named repo, or `--issue`)
  runs `/xplore` against that repo as before; **themed** (free-text topic, no repo) and **wildcard**
  (no direction at all) run a cross-repo `gh search issues` instead, since `Explore` agents can't
  reach remote GitHub. `repoRoot` is no longer resolved up front — each candidate's repo is
  cloned/synced lazily via a new persistent clone cache at `~/.claude/crg-farm/repos/<owner>/<repo>`
  once it survives `GATE-RECON`, and candidates sharing a repo are batched into one `--detect-only`
  triage pass. See `skills/crg-farm/methodology.md` §Sourcing candidates and §Clone cache.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **`/crg-farm` — a bug-farming loop over crg-debug.** A `user_invocable` main-loop orchestrator
  that sources real open bugs, triages them cheaply, escalates model capacity only where repair
  struggles, and ships draft PRs — with formal human approval at every consequential boundary. It
  *calls* crg-debug as a primitive (zero Workflow changes). Stages: RECON (`/xplore`) → dedup →
  TRIAGE (`--detect-only`) → FIX (`--from-ledger`, escalating haiku→sonnet→opus) → PR-prep. See
  `skills/crg-farm/`.
- **Two-pass duplicate-fix check in RECON** — before any triage spend, each candidate is verified
  as genuinely open AND not already being fixed: pass 1 dedups against our own farm history; pass 2
  checks the upstream repo (`gh issue view` / `gh search prs` / `gh pr list`) and classifies each
  candidate fresh / in-flight / already-fixed, dropping the latter two so the farm never produces a
  duplicate PR for a bug someone else already has in flight.
- **Named-Gate Protocol** — five repeatable approval gates (RECON, TRIAGE, ESCALATE, DIFF, SUBMIT)
  via `AskUserQuestion`. `GATE-DIFF` (working-tree→commit) and `GATE-SUBMIT` (fork→upstream) are
  HARD stops that `--auto` never bypasses; soft gates auto-pass under `--auto`.
- **Orchestrator-driven model escalation** — reads the Workflow's `ret.fix` return, narrows the
  ledger to just the unfixed bugs (`lib/ledger-slice.mjs`), and re-invokes `--from-ledger` at the
  next tier, so a stronger model only ever re-runs the hard bugs. Branches on failure channel
  (RED-not-observed vs a regressing final gate).
- **Farm database** — `lib/farm-db.mjs`, a global append-only JSONL at
  `~/.claude/crg-farm/history.jsonl` recording every run, candidate, gate decision, fix attempt,
  and PR across all repos. Enables cross-run candidate dedup (never re-work a shipped bug) and a
  full audit trail. `CRG_FARM_DB` overrides the path.
- `lib/ledger-slice.mjs` + `lib/farm-db.mjs` — standalone importable + CLI helpers (mirroring
  `issue-ref.mjs`), each with a zero-dependency `node --test` suite. Installed next to the workflow
  by the `crg-deterministic` enabler.

### Changed
- **Hardened the TDD RED step** (methodology + fix-agent prompt): a test that asserts the current
  buggy output or expects the reported exception (`assert_raises` on the very error) is INVALID —
  it codifies the bug and falsely "passes" RED. This is the guard the numpy einsum experiment
  showed was needed (the fix agent had degenerated to asserting the symptom).
- **Final gate narrows to the CRG blast radius** of touched files (impact radius + `tests_for` +
  affected flows) instead of running the whole suite — a fix run can no longer hang polling a giant
  test suite while still catching cross-file regressions.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **`--from-ledger <path>`** — resume from a prior read-only run's `.crg-debug/ledger.json` and skip
  straight to Phase 4 fix waves over the already-confirmed bugs. Enables a serialized
  detect → review → fix hand-off (run `--detect-only`, review the ledger, then fix it). Implies
  `fix=true`.

### Changed
- The deterministic workflow now resolves `methodology.md`'s path at runtime via
  `args.methodologyPath` (passed by the `/crg-debug` skill) instead of having it baked in by `sed`
  at install time — `crg-deterministic` now just copies `workflows/crg-debug.js` unmodified.
- README restyled with badges and section emojis (no content changes).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Point the sweep at an issue/ticket.** `--issue <ref>` (or a GitHub ref auto-detected in
  the freeform args — `#n`, `owner/repo#n`, or a full issue URL) fetches the issue via `gh` and
  drives the run from it: the issue resolves the file set *and* is threaded into the discovery
  finders, so they hunt the specific reported symptom rather than just "bugs in these files."
  Non-GitHub trackers (Jira/Linear/…) are supported via a paste fallback — pasted ticket text
  becomes the focus. The issue reference is recorded in the run header, the ledger, and the report.
- `lib/issue-ref.mjs` — a standalone, importable + CLI reference parser the skill calls to classify
  input deterministically (resolving `owner/repo` from the git origin for bare `#n`). Installed
  next to the workflow by the `crg-deterministic` enabler.
- Test suite (`node --test`, zero dependencies): `test/issue-ref.test.mjs` covers every reference
  form; `test/helpers.test.mjs` extracts the workflow's pure-helper block from the shipped source
  and tests it directly (no duplication).

### Changed
- The run model now defaults to **haiku**, overridable with `--model <name>` (`--model session`
  inherits the session model). Centralized in a `resolveModel` helper.
- Issue text is untrusted external input — it only ever reaches an agent through the existing
  `fence()` / `UNTRUSTED` guard, so a crafted issue body cannot steer the run.
- Consolidated the workflow's pure helpers (`fence`, `norm`, `keyOf`, `shortFile`, `bugFile`) and
  argument coercion (`resolveModel`, `clampRounds`, `capText`) into one dependency-free, unit-tested
  block.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Persist the confirmed-bug ledger to `.crg-debug/ledger.json`.
- Coupled-bug prose fallback: when per-bug fix waves stall on bugs that share one validating test,
  a single holistic prose attempt is made before escalating to a human.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Opt-in loop-until-dry discovery (`discoveryRounds`): re-run the finders, each round told what is
  already found, until a round surfaces nothing new or the cap is hit.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- `crg-debugger` subagent inherits the caller's model (was pinned to opus).
- Hold conflicted-verdict findings out of the fix queue.
- Namespaced the enabler binary as `crg-deterministic`.

### Added
- Initial release: graph-driven parallel debugging plugin for Claude Code — build the
  code-review-graph, map hotspots, fan out concern-disjoint finders, adversarially verify, and fix
  confirmed bugs in TDD waves over file-disjoint sets. Nothing is committed.
