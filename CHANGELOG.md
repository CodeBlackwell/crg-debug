# Changelog

All notable changes to the crg-debug plugin are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **`--from-ledger <path>`** — resume from a prior read-only run's `.crg-debug/ledger.json` and skip
  straight to Phase 4 fix waves over the already-confirmed bugs. Enables a serialized
  detect → review → fix hand-off (run `--detect-only`, review the ledger, then fix it). Implies
  `fix=true`.

### Changed
- The deterministic workflow now resolves `methodology.md`'s path at runtime via
  `args.methodologyPath` (passed by the `/crg-debug` skill) instead of having it baked in by `sed`
  at install time — `crg-deterministic` now just copies `workflows/crg-debug.js` unmodified.
- README restyled with badges and section emojis (no content changes).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Point the sweep at an issue/ticket.** `--issue <ref>` (or a GitHub ref auto-detected in
  the freeform args — `#n`, `owner/repo#n`, or a full issue URL) fetches the issue via `gh` and
  drives the run from it: the issue resolves the file set *and* is threaded into the discovery
  finders, so they hunt the specific reported symptom rather than just "bugs in these files."
  Non-GitHub trackers (Jira/Linear/…) are supported via a paste fallback — pasted ticket text
  becomes the focus. The issue reference is recorded in the run header, the ledger, and the report.
- `lib/issue-ref.mjs` — a standalone, importable + CLI reference parser the skill calls to classify
  input deterministically (resolving `owner/repo` from the git origin for bare `#n`). Installed
  next to the workflow by the `crg-deterministic` enabler.
- Test suite (`node --test`, zero dependencies): `test/issue-ref.test.mjs` covers every reference
  form; `test/helpers.test.mjs` extracts the workflow's pure-helper block from the shipped source
  and tests it directly (no duplication).

### Changed
- The run model now defaults to **haiku**, overridable with `--model <name>` (`--model session`
  inherits the session model). Centralized in a `resolveModel` helper.
- Issue text is untrusted external input — it only ever reaches an agent through the existing
  `fence()` / `UNTRUSTED` guard, so a crafted issue body cannot steer the run.
- Consolidated the workflow's pure helpers (`fence`, `norm`, `keyOf`, `shortFile`, `bugFile`) and
  argument coercion (`resolveModel`, `clampRounds`, `capText`) into one dependency-free, unit-tested
  block.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Persist the confirmed-bug ledger to `.crg-debug/ledger.json`.
- Coupled-bug prose fallback: when per-bug fix waves stall on bugs that share one validating test,
  a single holistic prose attempt is made before escalating to a human.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Opt-in loop-until-dry discovery (`discoveryRounds`): re-run the finders, each round told what is
  already found, until a round surfaces nothing new or the cap is hit.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- `crg-debugger` subagent inherits the caller's model (was pinned to opus).
- Hold conflicted-verdict findings out of the fix queue.
- Namespaced the enabler binary as `crg-deterministic`.

### Added
- Initial release: graph-driven parallel debugging plugin for Claude Code — build the
  code-review-graph, map hotspots, fan out concern-disjoint finders, adversarially verify, and fix
  confirmed bugs in TDD waves over file-disjoint sets. Nothing is committed.
